The antarctic climate is cold. I mean [b]really[/b] cold. The coldest temperatures on the planet was recorded in Vostok, Antarctica, at a brisk -128.6\u00B0F.

It's cold, windy, and very dry. It's so cold that the snow doesn't melt; the snow compacts over time and becomes part of the ice sheet. The ice sheet is on average 1.6km and covers around 98 percent of the continent.

Growing things here is a questionable choice.
