The Florida climate is defined by the hot and humid months, from as early as April to as late as October, and a temperate winter during the rest of the year.

[b]Florida Spring, Summer, and Fall[/b]
Springtime in Florida is very short-lived. The weather starts to warm up, and with it comes plenty of wind. The wind carries much of the humidity away, which makes for a much more enjoyable outdoor experience.
Once the heating up slows down, the humidity quickly increases. This hot and humid weather defines the Florida summer experience. It can go from an overcast morning, to a downpour in the afternoon, with clear skies and cool air by evening. Other times, the heat just keeps coming, and the humidity is suffocating.
When fall rolls around, it to does not last for much long. The cooling of the air means the atmosphere can't hold as much water. The rain is much cooler than the summer, but sunny days are still plenty.

[b]Florida Winter[/b]
Winter in Florida isn't really a winter. It's more of an extended autumn. The leaves fall in the northern parts, but most of lower Florida never drops below 60F. It's no wonder why New England elderly folks migrate here during the winter.
